Norse
=====

Norse is a library to do 
`deep learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning>`_ 
with 
`spiking neural networks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network>`_.

The purpose of this library is to exploit the advantages of `bio-inspired neural components <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network>`_, who are sparse and event-driven - a fundamental difference from artificial neural networks.
Norse expands on `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, bringing you two advantages: a modern and proven infrastructure and deep learning-compatible components.

Read more in the :ref:`page-spiking` and :ref:`page-working`.
 
Getting started
-------------------

To try Norse, the best option is to run our `Jupyter Notebook Tutorials <https://github.com/norse/notebooks/>`_ online. 

Alternatively, install Norse and run one of the `included tasks <https://norse.github.io/norse/tasks.html>`_ such as 
`MNIST <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database>`_:

.. code:: bash

    python -m norse.task.mnist

The :ref:`page-started` and :ref:`page-working` pages show how to build your own models with Norse while explaining a few
fundamental concepts around spiking neural networks.

Installing Norse
----------------------

Note that we assume you are using Python version 3.7+, are in a terminal friendly environment, and have installed the necessary requirements, 
depending on your installation method. 
More detailed installation instructions are available here: :ref:`page-installing`.

.. role:: bash(code)
    :language: bash

------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------
**From PyPi**             :bash:`pip install norse`                                                          `Pip <https://pypi.org/>`_
**From Conda**            :bash:`conda install -c norse norse`                                               `Conda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_
**From Source**           :bash:`git clone https://github.com/norse/norse && python norse/setup.py install`  `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
**With Docker**           :bash:`docker pull quay.io/norse/norse`                                            `Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_

Running Tasks
-------------

Norse comes with a number of example tasks, serving as short, self contained, correct examples `SSCCE <http://www.sscce.org/>`_.
They can be run by invoking the ``norse`` module from the base directory.
More information and tasks are available at :ref:`page-tasks` and in your console by typing: :bash:`python -m norse.task.<task> --help`, 
where ``<task>`` is one of the task names.

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m norse.task.mnist

Read more in our :ref:`page-spiking` and visit our `Jupyter Notebook examples <https://github.com/norse/notebooks>`_. 

Advanced uses and opimizations
------------------------------

Norse is meant to be used as a library for spiking neural networks in customized deep learning models.
This typically means porting other models to the spiking/temporal domain, 
extending existing models, 
or starting completely from scratch. 
All three use cases are motivated and briefly described in :ref:`page-working`.

Unfortunately, spiking neural networks are resource intensive.
The page on :ref:`page-hardware` explains how to accelerate the simulations using dedicated hardware.

About Norse
-----------

Norse is a research project created by Christian Pehle and Jens E. Pedersen.
Read more about why we created Norse in :ref:`page-about`.
