Running Experiments
-------------------

Norse arrives with a number of built-in examples.
They can be run with default parameters like so:

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m norse.task.<task>

where ``<task>`` is the name of the task you would like to run.

The tasks are also accessible directly in ``norse/task/``. All examples arrives with a number of flags that can change the behaviour of the task.
