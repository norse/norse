Learning with spikes
------------------------------------------

To be able to learn in spiking neural networks one needs to update the 
weights between neurons, as in all types of neural networks.

TBD, but for now we can refer to the excellent paper on 
`Surrogate Gradient Learning in Spiking Neural Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09948>`_ by
Emre O. Neftci, Hesham Mostafa, and Friedemann Zenke.
